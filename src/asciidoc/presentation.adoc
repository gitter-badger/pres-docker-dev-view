* Open Source - Although Docker was created by a commercial company (dotCloud), it's open-source and has a thriving community.
* Lightweight - Containers are insanely fast, providing bare-metal access to the hardware. No need to worry about a hypervisor layer.
* Self-sufficient - Each container comprises of just the application and its dependencies. It runs as an isolated process in userspace on the host operating system, sharing the kernel with other containers.
* Application - Containers package applications, not machines (making it application centric). Unlike traditional virtual machines a Docker container does not include a separate operating system.
* Run Anywhere - Run on any machine, with guaranteed consistency, for example: local (OS X, Linux, Windows), Data Centre (Red Hat, etc.) and Cloud Infrastructure (AWS EC2, Rackspace, etc.)
